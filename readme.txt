== ABOUT ==

The Evolution is a minimalistic multi-purpose block theme. It was designed specially for blogs and personal portifolios. It also can be used in small business and another projects. Fully responsible to adapt to any screen size, it includes footer with social widgets and a navigation menu, perfect to display links to legal notes. 

From single page website to complex navigations, The Evolution is a great theme to publish stories, tutorials, documentations, etc. This theme was first designed for MatheusMisumoto.dev, my personal website. This version of The Evolution is enabled to full-editing website feature of WordPress, and I decided to make it part of the public gallery of WordPress themes.
